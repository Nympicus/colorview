# ColorView

A tiny, single-file terminal tool to display colors from hex codes as colored blocks. True Color terminals supported.  

## Features

- Display colors from **hex codes** (e.g., `0xFF4500`) in the terminal.  
- Minimal, single-file implementation.  
- Works on True Color compatible terminals (Kitty, GNOME Terminal, etc.).  

## Usage

```bash
./colorview 0xFF4500   # Shows a block with the color
./colorview FFA07A     # Also supported without 0x prefix
